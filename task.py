# Task 1
# Write a python program to display students grade
# First ask user score using input method
# Check if user score above 90, print your grade is A
# Check if user score above 75, print your grade is B
# Check if user score above 65, print your grade is C
# Check if user score below 40, print your grade is Fail 


# score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

# score > 100
# print("Plz Enter Valid Score ")

# if score<=100:
#     if score > 90:
#         print("Your grade is A")    
#     elif score > 75:
#         print("Your grade is B")
#     elif score > 65:
#         print("Your grade is C")
#     else:
#         print("Your grade is Fail")

# else:
#     print("error")


# write a program to calculate the electricity bill according to the following data.

# units = int(input("Enter your unit for Payment"))
# cost = 0
# if units <= 100:
#     print("No charge")
# elif units > 100:
#     cost = (units - 100) * 5
# elif units > 150:
#     cost = (150* 10) + (100*5)
# print("Your bill cost",{cost})


# Loop in python  with else example

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "grapes"]
# for index in range (len(fruits)):
#     print(fruits[index])
# else:
#     print(len(fruits))

# While loop
